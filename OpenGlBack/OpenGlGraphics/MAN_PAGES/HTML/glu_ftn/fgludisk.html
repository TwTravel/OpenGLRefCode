     <STRONG>FORTRAN</STRONG> <STRONG>SPECIFICATION</STRONG>
	  SUBROUTINE <STRONG>fgluDisk</STRONG>( CHARACTER*8 <EM>quad</EM>,
			       REAL*8 <EM>inner</EM>,
			       REAL*8 <EM>outer</EM>,
			       INTEGER*4 <EM>slices</EM>,
			       INTEGER*4 <EM>loops</EM> )


     <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>
	  <EM>quad</EM>	  Specifies the	quadrics object	(created with
		  <STRONG>fgluNewQuadric</STRONG>).

	  <EM>inner</EM>	  Specifies the	inner radius of	the disk (may be 0).

	  <EM>outer</EM>	  Specifies the	outer radius of	the disk.

	  <EM>slices</EM>  Specifies the	number of subdivisions around the <EM>z</EM>
		  axis.

	  <EM>loops</EM>	  Specifies the	number of concentric rings about the
		  origin into which the	disk is	subdivided.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>fgluDisk</STRONG> renders a disk on the <EM>z</EM> = 0 plane. The disk has a
	  radius of <EM>outer</EM>, and contains	a concentric circular hole
	  with a radius	of <EM>inner</EM>. If <EM>inner</EM> is 0, then no hole is
	  generated. The disk is subdivided around the <EM>z</EM> axis into
	  slices (like pizza slices), and also about the <EM>z</EM> axis	into
	  rings	(as specified by <EM>slices</EM>	and <EM>loops</EM>, respectively).

	  With respect to orientation, the +<EM>z</EM> side of the disk is
	  considered to	be "outside" (see <STRONG>fgluQuadricOrientation</STRONG>).
	  This means that if the orientation is	set to <STRONG>GLU_OUTSIDE</STRONG>,
	  then any normals generated point along the +<EM>z</EM>	axis.
	  Otherwise, they point	along the -<EM>z</EM> axis.

	  If texturing has been	turned on (with	<STRONG>fgluQuadricTexture</STRONG>),
	  texture coordinates are generated linearly such that where
	  r=outer, the value at	(<EM>r</EM>, 0, 0) is (1, 0.5), at (0, <EM>r</EM>, 0) it
	  is (0.5, 1), at (-<EM>r</EM>, 0, 0) it	is (0, 0.5), and at (0,	-<EM>r</EM>, 0)
	  it is	(0.5, 0).
