     <STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>fglAreTexturesResident</STRONG> - determine if	textures are loaded in
	  texture memory


     <STRONG>FORTRAN</STRONG> <STRONG>SPECIFICATION</STRONG>
	  LOGICAL*1 <STRONG>fglAreTexturesResident</STRONG>( INTEGER*4 <EM>n</EM>,
					    CHARACTER*8	<EM>textures</EM>,
					    CHARACTER*8	<EM>residences</EM> )


     <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>
	  <EM>n</EM>	      Specifies	the number of textures to be queried.

	  <EM>textures</EM>    Specifies	an array containing the	names of the
		      textures to be queried.

	  <EM>residences</EM>  Specifies	an array in which the texture
		      residence	status is returned.  The residence
		      status of	a texture named	by an element of
		      <EM>textures</EM> is returned in the corresponding
		      element of <EM>residences</EM>.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
	  GL establishes a ``working set'' of textures that are
	  resident in texture memory.  These textures can be bound to
	  a texture target much	more efficiently than textures that
	  are not resident.

	  <STRONG>fglAreTexturesResident</STRONG> queries the texture residence status
	  of the <EM>n</EM> textures named by the elements of <EM>textures</EM>.	If all
	  the named textures are resident, <STRONG>fglAreTexturesResident</STRONG>
	  returns <STRONG>GL_TRUE</STRONG>, and the contents of <EM>residences</EM> are
	  undisturbed.	If not all the named textures are resident,
	  <STRONG>fglAreTexturesResident</STRONG> returns <STRONG>GL_FALSE</STRONG>, and detailed	status
	  is returned in the <EM>n</EM> elements	of <EM>residences</EM>.	If an element
	  of <EM>residences</EM>	is <STRONG>GL_TRUE</STRONG>, then the texture named by the
	  corresponding	element	of <EM>textures</EM> is resident.

	  The residence	status of a single bound texture may also be
	  queried by calling <STRONG>fglGetTexParameter</STRONG>	with the <EM>target</EM>
	  argument set to the target to	which the texture is bound,
	  and the <EM>p</EM>_<EM>name</EM> argument set to <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_RESIDENT</STRONG>.  This is
	  the only way that the	residence status of a default texture
	  can be queried.

     <STRONG>NOTES</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>fglAreTexturesResident</STRONG> is available only if the GL version
	  is 1.1 or greater.

	  <STRONG>fglAreTexturesResident</STRONG> returns the residency status of the
	  textures at the time of invocation. It does not guarantee
	  that the textures will remain	resident at any	other time.

	  If textures reside in	virtual	memory (there is no texture
	  memory), they	are considered always resident.

	  Some implementations may not load a texture until the	first
	  use of that texture.

     <STRONG>ERRORS</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_VALUE</STRONG> is generated	if <EM>n</EM> is	negative.

	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_VALUE</STRONG> is generated	if any element in <EM>textures</EM> is
	  0 or does not	name a texture.	In that	case, the function
	  returns <STRONG>GL_FALSE</STRONG> and the contents of <EM>residences</EM> is
	  indeterminate.

	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</STRONG> is generated if <STRONG>fglAreTexturesResident</STRONG>
	  is executed between the execution of <STRONG>fglBegin</STRONG>	and the
	  corresponding	execution of <STRONG>fglEnd</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>ASSOCIATED</STRONG>	<STRONG>GETS</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>fglGetTexParameter</STRONG> with parameter name <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_RESIDENT</STRONG>
	  retrieves the	residence status of a currently	bound texture.
