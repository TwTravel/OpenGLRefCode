	  <STRONG>gluNextContour</STRONG> - mark	the beginning of another contour


     <STRONG>C</STRONG> <STRONG>SPECIFICATION</STRONG>
	  void <STRONG>gluNextContour</STRONG>( GLUtesselator* <EM>tess</EM>,
			       GLenum <EM>type</EM> )


     <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>
	  <EM>tess</EM>	Specifies the tessellation object (created with
		<STRONG>gluNewTess</STRONG>).

	  <EM>type</EM>	Specifies the type of the contour being	defined. Valid
		values are <STRONG>GLU_EXTERIOR</STRONG>, <STRONG>GLU_INTERIOR</STRONG>, <STRONG>GLU_UNKNOWN</STRONG>,
		<STRONG>GLU_CCW</STRONG>, and <STRONG>GLU_CW</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>gluNextContour</STRONG> is used in describing polygons	with multiple
	  contours. After the first contour has	been described through
	  a series of <STRONG>gluTessVertex</STRONG> calls, a <STRONG>gluNextContour</STRONG> call
	  indicates that the previous contour is complete and that the
	  next contour is about	to begin.  Another series of
	  <STRONG>gluTessVertex</STRONG>	calls is then used to describe the new
	  contour. This	process	can be repeated	until all contours
	  have been described.

	  <EM>type</EM> defines what type of contour follows.  The legal
	  contour types	are as follows:

	  <STRONG>GLU_EXTERIOR</STRONG>	    An exterior	contour	defines	an exterior
			    boundary of	the polygon.

	  <STRONG>GLU_INTERIOR</STRONG>	    An interior	contour	defines	an interior
			    boundary of	the polygon (such as a hole).

	  <STRONG>GLU_UNKNOWN</STRONG>	    An unknown contour is analyzed by the
			    library to determine if it is interior or
			    exterior.

	  <STRONG>GLU_CCW</STRONG>,

	  <STRONG>GLU_CW</STRONG>	    The	first <STRONG>GLU_CCW</STRONG> or <STRONG>GLU_CW</STRONG>	contour
			    defined is considered to be	exterior. All
			    other contours are considered to be
			    exterior if	they are oriented in the same
			    direction (clockwise or counterclockwise)
			    as the first contour, and interior if they
			    are	not.

	  If one contour is of type <STRONG>GLU_CCW</STRONG> or <STRONG>GLU_CW</STRONG>, then all
	  contours must	be of the same type (if	they are not, then all
	  <STRONG>GLU_CCW</STRONG> and <STRONG>GLU_CW</STRONG> contours will be changed to <STRONG>GLU_UNKNOWN</STRONG>).

	  Note that there is no	real difference	between	the <STRONG>GLU_CCW</STRONG>
	  and <STRONG>GLU_CW</STRONG> contour types.

	  Before the first contour is described, <STRONG>gluNextContour</STRONG>	can be
	  called to define the type of the first contour.  If
	  <STRONG>gluNextContour</STRONG> is not	called before the first	contour, then
	  the first contour is marked <STRONG>GLU_EXTERIOR</STRONG>.

	  This command is obsolete and is provided for backward
	  compatibility	only. Calls to <STRONG>gluNextContour</STRONG> are mapped to
	  <STRONG>gluTessEndContour</STRONG> followed by	<STRONG>gluTessBeginContour</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>EXAMPLE</STRONG>
	  A quadrilateral with a triangular hole in it can be
	  described as follows:

	  gluBeginPolygon(tobj);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4); gluNextContour(tobj,
	  GLU_INTERIOR);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7); gluEndPolygon(tobj);
