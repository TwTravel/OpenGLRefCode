     <STRONG>NAME</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>gluTessVertex</STRONG>	- specify a vertex on a	polygon


     <STRONG>C</STRONG> <STRONG>SPECIFICATION</STRONG>
	  void <STRONG>gluTessVertex</STRONG>( GLUtesselator* <EM>tess</EM>,
			      GLdouble *<EM>location</EM>,
			      GLvoid* <EM>data</EM> )


     <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>
	  <EM>tess</EM>	    Specifies the tessellation object (created with
		    <STRONG>gluNewTess</STRONG>).

	  <EM>location</EM>  Specifies the location of the vertex.

	  <EM>data</EM>	    Specifies an opaque	pointer	passed back to the
		    program with the vertex callback (as specified by
		    <STRONG>gluTessCallback</STRONG>).

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>gluTessVertex</STRONG>	describes a vertex on a	polygon	that the
	  program defines. Successive <STRONG>gluTessVertex</STRONG> calls describe a
	  closed contour. For example, to describe a quadrilateral
	  <STRONG>gluTessVertex</STRONG>	should be called four times.  <STRONG>gluTessVertex</STRONG>
	  can only be called between <STRONG>gluTessBeginContour</STRONG> and
	  <STRONG>gluTessEndContour</STRONG>.

	  <EM>data</EM> normally	points to a structure containing the vertex
	  location, as well as other per-vertex	attributes such	as
	  color	and normal.  This pointer is passed back to the	user
	  through the <STRONG>GLU_TESS_VERTEX</STRONG> or <STRONG>GLU_TESS_VERTEX_DATA</STRONG> callback
	  after	tessellation (see the <STRONG>gluTessCallback</STRONG> reference	page).

     <STRONG>EXAMPLE</STRONG>
	  A quadrilateral with a triangular hole in it can be
	  described as follows:

	  gluTessBeginPolygon(tobj, NULL);
	   gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4);
	   gluTessEndContour(tobj);
	   gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
	     gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7);
	   gluTessEndContour(tobj); gluTessEndPolygon(tobj);


     <STRONG>NOTES</STRONG>
	  It is	a common error to use a	local variable for <EM>location</EM> or
	  <EM>data</EM> and store values	into it	as part	of a loop.  For
	  example:  for	(i = 0;	i &lt; NVERTICES; ++i) {
	    GLdouble data[3];
	    data[0] = vertex[i][0];
	    data[1] = vertex[i][1];
	    data[2] = vertex[i][2];
	    gluTessVertex(tobj,	data, data);
	    }

	  This doesn't work.  Because the pointers specified by
	  <EM>location</EM> and <EM>data</EM> might not be dereferenced until
	  <STRONG>gluTessEndPolygon</STRONG> is executed, all the vertex	coordinates
	  but the very last set	could be overwritten before
	  tessellation begins.

	  Two common symptoms of this problem are consists of a	single
	  point	(when a	local variable is used for <EM>data</EM>) and a
	  <STRONG>GLU_TESS_NEED_COMBINE_CALLBACK</STRONG> error (when a local variable
	  is used for <EM>location</EM>).
