	  <STRONG>glShadeModel</STRONG> - select	flat or	smooth shading


     <STRONG>C</STRONG> <STRONG>SPECIFICATION</STRONG>
	  void <STRONG>glShadeModel</STRONG>( GLenum <EM>mode</EM> )


     <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>
	  <EM>mode</EM>	Specifies a symbolic value representing	a shading
		technique.  Accepted values are	<STRONG>GL_FLAT</STRONG>	and <STRONG>GL_SMOOTH</STRONG>.
		The initial value is <STRONG>GL_SMOOTH</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
	  GL primitives	can have either	flat or	smooth shading.
	  Smooth shading, the default, causes the computed colors of
	  vertices to be interpolated as the primitive is rasterized,
	  typically assigning different	colors to each resulting pixel
	  fragment.  Flat shading selects the computed color of	just
	  one vertex and assigns it to all the pixel fragments
	  generated by rasterizing a single primitive.	In either
	  case,	the computed color of a	vertex is the result of
	  lighting if lighting is enabled, or it is the	current	color
	  at the time the vertex was specified if lighting is
	  disabled.

	  Flat and smooth shading are indistinguishable	for points.
	  Starting when	<STRONG>glBegin</STRONG>	is issued and counting vertices	and
	  primitives from 1, the GL gives each flat-shaded line
	  segment i the	computed color of vertex i+1, its second
	  vertex.  Counting similarly from 1, the GL gives each	flat-
	  shaded polygon the computed color of the vertex listed in
	  the following	table.	This is	the last vertex	to specify the
	  polygon in all cases except single polygons, where the first
	  vertex specifies the flat-shaded color.

	  Flat and smooth shading are specified	by <STRONG>glShadeModel</STRONG>	with
	  <EM>mode</EM> set to <STRONG>GL_FLAT</STRONG> and <STRONG>GL_SMOOTH</STRONG>, respectively.

     <STRONG>ERRORS</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_ENUM</STRONG> is generated if <EM>mode</EM> is any value other than
	  <STRONG>GL_FLAT</STRONG> or <STRONG>GL_SMOOTH</STRONG>.

	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</STRONG> is generated if <STRONG>glShadeModel</STRONG> is
	  executed between the execution of <STRONG>glBegin</STRONG> and	the
	  corresponding	execution of <STRONG>glEnd</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>ASSOCIATED</STRONG>	<STRONG>GETS</STRONG>
