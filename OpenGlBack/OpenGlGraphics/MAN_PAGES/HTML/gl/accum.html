	  <STRONG>glAccum</STRONG> - operate on the accumulation	buffer


     <STRONG>C</STRONG> <STRONG>SPECIFICATION</STRONG>
	  void <STRONG>glAccum</STRONG>(	GLenum <EM>op</EM>,
			GLfloat	<EM>value</EM> )


     <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>
	  <EM>op</EM>	 Specifies the accumulation buffer operation.
		 Symbolic constants <STRONG>GL_ACCUM</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_LOAD</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_ADD</STRONG>,
		 <STRONG>GL_MULT</STRONG>, and <STRONG>GL_RETURN</STRONG>	are accepted.

	  <EM>value</EM>	 Specifies a floating-point value used in the
		 accumulation buffer operation.	 <EM>op</EM> determines how
		 <EM>value</EM> is used.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
	  The accumulation buffer is an	extended-range color buffer.
	  Images are not rendered into it.  Rather, images rendered
	  into one of the color	buffers	are added to the contents of
	  the accumulation buffer after	rendering.  Effects such as
	  antialiasing (of points, lines, and polygons), motion	blur,
	  and depth of field can be created by accumulating images
	  generated with different transformation matrices.

	  Each pixel in	the accumulation buffer	consists of red,
	  green, blue, and alpha values.  The number of	bits per
	  component in the accumulation	buffer depends on the
	  implementation. You can examine this number by calling
	  <STRONG>glGetIntegerv</STRONG>	four times, with arguments <STRONG>GL_ACCUM_RED_BITS</STRONG>,
	  <STRONG>GL_ACCUM_GREEN_BITS</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_ACCUM_BLUE_BITS</STRONG>, and
	  <STRONG>GL_ACCUM_ALPHA_BITS</STRONG>.	Regardless of the number of bits per
	  component, the range of values stored	by each	component is
	  [-1, 1].  The	accumulation buffer pixels are mapped one-to-
	  one with frame buffer	pixels.

	  <STRONG>glAccum</STRONG> operates on the accumulation buffer.	The first
	  argument, <EM>op</EM>,	is a symbolic constant that selects an
	  accumulation buffer operation.  The second argument, <EM>value</EM>,
	  is a floating-point value to be used in that operation.
	  Five operations are specified:  <STRONG>GL_ACCUM</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_LOAD</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_ADD</STRONG>,
	  <STRONG>GL_MULT</STRONG>, and <STRONG>GL_RETURN</STRONG>.

	  All accumulation buffer operations are limited to the	area
	  of the current scissor box and applied identically to	the
	  red, green, blue, and	alpha components of each pixel.	 If a
	  <STRONG>glAccum</STRONG> operation results in a value outside the range [-1,
	  1], the contents of an accumulation buffer pixel component
	  are undefined.

	  The operations are as	follows:

	  <STRONG>GL_ACCUM</STRONG>	Obtains	R, G, B, and A values from the buffer
			currently selected for reading (see
			<STRONG>glReadBuffer</STRONG>).	Each component value is
			divided	by 2n-1, where n is the	number of bits
			allocated to each color	component in the
			currently selected buffer.  The	result is a
			floating-point value in	the range [0, 1],
			which is multiplied by <EM>value</EM> and added to the
			corresponding pixel component in the
			accumulation buffer, thereby updating the
			accumulation buffer.

	  <STRONG>GL_LOAD</STRONG>	Similar	to <STRONG>GL_ACCUM</STRONG>, except that the current
			value in the accumulation buffer is not	used
			in the calculation of the new value.  That is,
			the R, G, B, and A values from the currently
			selected buffer	are divided by 2n-1,
			multiplied by <EM>value</EM>, and then stored in	the
			corresponding accumulation buffer cell,
			overwriting the	current	value.

	  <STRONG>GL_ADD</STRONG>	Adds <EM>value</EM> to each R, G, B, and	A in the
			accumulation buffer.

	  <STRONG>GL_MULT</STRONG>	Multiplies each	R, G, B, and A in the
			accumulation buffer by <EM>value</EM> and returns the
			scaled component to its	corresponding
			accumulation buffer location.

	  <STRONG>GL_RETURN</STRONG>	Transfers accumulation buffer values to	the
			color buffer or	buffers	currently selected for
			writing.  Each R, G, B,	and A component	is
			multiplied by <EM>value</EM>, then multiplied by	2n-1,
			clamped	to the range [0,2n-1], and stored in
			the corresponding display buffer cell.	The
			only fragment operations that are applied to
			this transfer are pixel	ownership, scissor,
			dithering, and color writemasks.

	  To clear the accumulation buffer, call <STRONG>glClearAccum</STRONG> with R,
	  G, B,	and A values to	set it to, then	call <STRONG>glClear</STRONG> with the
	  accumulation buffer enabled.

     <STRONG>NOTES</STRONG>
	  Only pixels within the current scissor box are updated by a
	  <STRONG>glAccum</STRONG> operation.

     <STRONG>ERRORS</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_ENUM</STRONG> is generated if <EM>op</EM> is	not an accepted	value.

	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</STRONG> is generated if there is	no
	  accumulation buffer.

	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</STRONG> is generated if <STRONG>glAccum</STRONG> is executed
	  between the execution	of <STRONG>glBegin</STRONG> and the corresponding
	  execution of <STRONG>glEnd</STRONG>.

     <STRONG>ASSOCIATED</STRONG>	<STRONG>GETS</STRONG>

	  <STRONG>glGet</STRONG>	with argument <STRONG>GL_ACCUM_GREEN_BITS</STRONG>
