     <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>
	  <EM>light</EM>
	       Specifies a light.  The number of lights	depends	on the
	       implementation, but at least eight lights are
	       supported.  They	are identified by symbolic names of
	       the form	<STRONG>GL_LIGHT</STRONG>i where	0 <EM>&lt;</EM> i &lt;	<STRONG>GL_MAX_LIGHTS</STRONG>.

	  <EM>pname</EM>
	       Specifies a light source	parameter for <EM>light</EM>.
	       <STRONG>GL_AMBIENT</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_DIFFUSE</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_SPECULAR</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_POSITION</STRONG>,
	       <STRONG>GL_SPOT_CUTOFF</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_SPOT_DIRECTION</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_SPOT_EXPONENT</STRONG>,
	       <STRONG>GL_CONSTANT_ATTENUATION</STRONG>,	<STRONG>GL_LINEAR_ATTENUATION</STRONG>, and
	       <STRONG>GL_QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION</STRONG>	are accepted.

	  <EM>params</EM>
	       Specifies a pointer to the value	or values that
	       parameter <EM>pname</EM> of light	source <EM>light</EM> will be set to.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>glLight</STRONG> sets the values of individual	light source
	  parameters.  <EM>light</EM> names the light and is a symbolic name of
	  the form <STRONG>GL_LIGHT</STRONG>i, where 0 <EM>&lt;</EM>	i &lt; <STRONG>GL_MAX_LIGHTS</STRONG>.  <EM>pname</EM>
	  specifies one	of ten light source parameters,	again by
	  symbolic name.  <EM>params</EM> is either a single value or a pointer
	  to an	array that contains the	new values.

	  To enable and	disable	lighting calculation, call <STRONG>glEnable</STRONG>
	  and <STRONG>glDisable</STRONG>	with argument <STRONG>GL_LIGHTING</STRONG>. Lighting is
	  initially disabled.  When it is enabled, light sources that
	  are enabled contribute to the	lighting calculation.  Light
	  source i is enabled and disabled using <STRONG>glEnable</STRONG> and
	  <STRONG>glDisable</STRONG> with argument <STRONG>GL_LIGHT</STRONG>i.

	  The ten light	parameters are as follows:

	  <STRONG>GL_AMBIENT</STRONG>	      <EM>params</EM> contains four integer or
			      floating-point values that specify the
			      ambient RGBA intensity of	the light.
			      Integer values are mapped	linearly such
			      that the most positive representable
			      value maps to 1.0, and the most negative
			      representable value maps to -1.0.
			      Floating-point values are	mapped
			      directly.	 Neither integer nor
			      floating-point values are	clamped.  The
			      initial ambient light intensity is (0,
			      0, 0, 1).

	  <STRONG>GL_DIFFUSE</STRONG>	      <EM>params</EM> contains four integer or
			      floating-point values that specify the
			      diffuse RGBA intensity of	the light.
			      Integer values are mapped	linearly such
			      that the most positive representable
			      value maps to 1.0, and the most negative
			      representable value maps to -1.0.
			      Floating-point values are	mapped
			      directly.	 Neither integer nor
			      floating-point values are	clamped.  The
			      initial value for	<STRONG>GL_LIGHT0</STRONG> is (1, 1, 1,
			      1); for other lights, the	initial	value
			      is (0, 0,	0, 0).

	  <STRONG>GL_SPECULAR</STRONG>	      <EM>params</EM> contains four integer or
			      floating-point values that specify the
			      specular RGBA intensity of the light.
			      Integer values are mapped	linearly such
			      that the most positive representable
			      value maps to 1.0, and the most negative
			      representable value maps to -1.0.
			      Floating-point values are	mapped
			      directly.	 Neither integer nor
			      floating-point values are	clamped.  The
			      initial value for	<STRONG>GL_LIGHT0</STRONG> is (1, 1, 1,
			      1); for other lights, the	initial	value
			      is (0, 0,	0, 0).

	  <STRONG>GL_POSITION</STRONG>	      <EM>params</EM> contains four integer or
			      floating-point values that specify the
			      position of the light in homogeneous
			      object coordinates.  Both	integer	and
			      floating-point values are	mapped
			      directly.	 Neither integer nor
			      floating-point values are	clamped.

			      The position is transformed by the
			      modelview	matrix when <STRONG>glLight</STRONG> is called
			      (just as if it were a point), and	it is
			      stored in	eye coordinates.  If the w
			      component	of the position	is 0, the
			      light is treated as a directional
			      source.  Diffuse and specular lighting
			      calculations take	the light's direction,
			      but not its actual position, into
			      account, and attenuation is disabled.
			      Otherwise, diffuse and specular lighting
			      calculations are based on	the actual
			      location of the light in eye
			      coordinates, and attenuation is enabled.
			      The initial position is (0, 0, 1,	0);
			      thus, the	initial	light source is
			      directional, parallel to,	and in the
			      direction	of the -z axis.

	  <STRONG>GL_SPOT_DIRECTION</STRONG>   <EM>params</EM> contains three integer or
			      floating-point values that specify the
			      direction	of the light in	homogeneous
			      object coordinates.  Both	integer	and
			      floating-point values are	mapped
			      directly.	 Neither integer nor
			      floating-point values are	clamped.

			      The spot direction is transformed	by the
			      inverse of the modelview matrix when
			      <STRONG>glLight</STRONG> is called	(just as if it were a
			      normal), and it is stored	in eye
			      coordinates.  It is significant only
			      when <STRONG>GL_SPOT_CUTOFF</STRONG> is not 180, which it
			      is initially.  The initial direction is
			      (0, 0, -1).

	  <STRONG>GL_SPOT_EXPONENT</STRONG>    <EM>params</EM> is	a single integer or floating-
			      point value that specifies the intensity
			      distribution of the light.  Integer and
			      floating-point values are	mapped
			      directly.	 Only values in	the range
			      [0,128] are accepted.

			      Effective	light intensity	is attenuated
			      by the cosine of the angle between the
			      direction	of the light and the direction
			      from the light to	the vertex being
			      lighted, raised to the power of the spot
			      exponent.	 Thus, higher spot exponents
			      result in	a more focused light source,
			      regardless of the	spot cutoff angle (see
			      <STRONG>GL_SPOT_CUTOFF</STRONG>, next paragraph).	The
			      initial spot exponent is 0, resulting in
			      uniform light distribution.

	  <STRONG>GL_SPOT_CUTOFF</STRONG>      <EM>params</EM> is	a single integer or floating-
			      point value that specifies the maximum
			      spread angle of a	light source.  Integer
			      and floating-point values	are mapped
			      directly.	 Only values in	the range
			      [0,90] and the special value 180 are
			      accepted.	 If the	angle between the
			      direction	of the light and the direction
			      from the light to	the vertex being
			      lighted is greater than the spot cutoff
			      angle, the light is completely masked.
			      Otherwise, its intensity is controlled
			      by the spot exponent and the attenuation
			      factors.	The initial spot cutoff	is
			      180, resulting in	uniform	light
			      distribution.

	  <STRONG>GL_CONSTANT_ATTENUATION</STRONG>

	  <STRONG>GL_LINEAR_ATTENUATION</STRONG>

	  <STRONG>GL_QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION</STRONG>
			      <EM>params</EM> is	a single integer or floating-
			      point value that specifies one of	the
			      three light attenuation factors.
			      Integer and floating-point values	are
			      mapped directly.	Only nonnegative
			      values are accepted.  If the light is
			      positional, rather than directional, its
			      intensity	is attenuated by the
			      reciprocal of the	sum of the constant
			      factor, the linear factor	times the
			      distance between the light and the
			      vertex being lighted, and	the quadratic
			      factor times the square of the same
			      distance.	 The initial attenuation
			      factors are (1, 0, 0), resulting in no
			      attenuation.

     <STRONG>NOTES</STRONG>
	  It is	always the case	that <STRONG>GL_LIGHT</STRONG>i = <STRONG>GL_LIGHT0</STRONG> + i.

     <STRONG>ERRORS</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_ENUM</STRONG> is generated if either <EM>light</EM> or <EM>pname</EM>	is not
	  an accepted value.

	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_VALUE</STRONG> is generated	if a spot exponent value is
	  specified outside the	range [0,128], or if spot cutoff is
	  specified outside the	range [0,90] (except for the special
	  value	180), or if a negative attenuation factor is
	  specified.

	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</STRONG> is generated if <STRONG>glLight</STRONG> is executed
	  between the execution	of <STRONG>glBegin</STRONG> and the corresponding
	  execution of <STRONG>glEnd</STRONG>.
