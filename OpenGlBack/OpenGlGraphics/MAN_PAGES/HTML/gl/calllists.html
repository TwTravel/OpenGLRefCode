	  <STRONG>glCallLists</STRONG> -	execute	a list of display lists


     <STRONG>C</STRONG> <STRONG>SPECIFICATION</STRONG>
	  void <STRONG>glCallLists</STRONG>( GLsizei <EM>n</EM>,
			    GLenum <EM>type</EM>,
			    const GLvoid *<EM>lists</EM>	)


     <STRONG>PARAMETERS</STRONG>
	  <EM>n</EM>	 Specifies the number of display lists to be executed.

	  <EM>type</EM>	 Specifies the type of values in <EM>lists</EM>.	 Symbolic
		 constants <STRONG>GL_BYTE</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_SHORT</STRONG>,
		 <STRONG>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_INT</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_UNSIGNED_INT</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_FLOAT</STRONG>,
		 <STRONG>GL_2_BYTES</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_3_BYTES</STRONG>, and <STRONG>GL_4_BYTES</STRONG>	are accepted.

	  <EM>lists</EM>	 Specifies the address of an array of name offsets in
		 the display list.  The	pointer	type is	void because
		 the offsets can be bytes, shorts, ints, or floats,
		 depending on the value	of <EM>type</EM>.

     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>glCallLists</STRONG> causes each display list in the list of names
	  passed as <EM>lists</EM> to be	executed.  As a	result,	the commands
	  saved	in each	display	list are executed in order, just as if
	  they were called without using a display list.  Names	of
	  display lists	that have not been defined are ignored.

	  <STRONG>glCallLists</STRONG> provides an efficient means for executing	more
	  than one display list.  <EM>type</EM> allows lists with various name
	  formats to be	accepted.  The formats are as follows:

	  <STRONG>GL_BYTE</STRONG>		   <EM>lists</EM> is treated as an array	of
				   signed bytes, each in the range
				   -128	through	127.

	  <STRONG>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</STRONG>	   <EM>lists</EM> is treated as an array	of
				   unsigned bytes, each	in the range 0
				   through 255.

	  <STRONG>GL_SHORT</STRONG>		   <EM>lists</EM> is treated as an array	of
				   signed two-byte integers, each in
				   the range -32768 through 32767.

	  <STRONG>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT</STRONG>	   <EM>lists</EM> is treated as an array	of
				   unsigned two-byte integers, each in
				   the range 0 through 65535.

	  <STRONG>GL_INT</STRONG>		   <EM>lists</EM> is treated as an array	of
				   signed four-byte integers.

	  <STRONG>GL_UNSIGNED_INT</STRONG>	   <EM>lists</EM> is treated as an array	of
				   unsigned four-byte integers.

	  <STRONG>GL_FLOAT</STRONG>		   <EM>lists</EM> is treated as an array	of
				   four-byte floating-point values.

	  <STRONG>GL_2_BYTES</STRONG>		   <EM>lists</EM> is treated as an array	of
				   unsigned bytes.  Each pair of bytes
				   specifies a single display-list
				   name.  The value of the pair	is
				   computed as 256 times the unsigned
				   value of the	first byte plus	the
				   unsigned value of the second	byte.

	  <STRONG>GL_3_BYTES</STRONG>		   <EM>lists</EM> is treated as an array	of
				   unsigned bytes.  Each triplet of
				   bytes specifies a single display-
				   list	name.  The value of the
				   triplet is computed as 65536	times
				   the unsigned	value of the first
				   byte, plus 256 times	the unsigned
				   value of the	second byte, plus the
				   unsigned value of the third byte.

	  <STRONG>GL_4_BYTES</STRONG>		   <EM>lists</EM> is treated as an array	of
				   unsigned bytes.  Each quadruplet of
				   bytes specifies a single display-
				   list	name.  The value of the
				   quadruplet is computed as 16777216
				   times the unsigned value of the
				   first byte, plus 65536 times	the
				   unsigned value of the second	byte,
				   plus	256 times the unsigned value
				   of the third	byte, plus the
				   unsigned value of the fourth	byte.

	  The list of display-list names is not	null-terminated.
	  Rather, <EM>n</EM> specifies how many names are to be taken from
	  <EM>lists</EM>.

	  An additional	level of indirection is	made available with
	  the <STRONG>glListBase</STRONG> command, which	specifies an unsigned offset
	  that is added	to each	display-list name specified in <EM>lists</EM>
	  before that display list is executed.

	  <STRONG>glCallLists</STRONG> can appear inside	a display list.	 To avoid the
	  possibility of infinite recursion resulting from display
	  lists	calling	one another, a limit is	placed on the nesting
	  level	of display lists during	display-list execution.	 This
	  limit	must be	at least 64, and it depends on the
	  implementation.

	  GL state is not saved	and restored across a call to
	  <STRONG>glCallLists</STRONG>.	Thus, changes made to GL state during the
	  execution of the display lists remain	after execution	is
	  completed.  Use <STRONG>glPushAttrib</STRONG>,	<STRONG>glPopAttrib</STRONG>, <STRONG>glPushMatrix</STRONG>, and
	  <STRONG>glPopMatrix</STRONG> to preserve GL state across <STRONG>glCallLists</STRONG> calls.

     <STRONG>NOTES</STRONG>
	  Display lists	can be executed	between	a call to <STRONG>glBegin</STRONG> and
	  the corresponding call to <STRONG>glEnd</STRONG>, as long as the display list
	  includes only	commands that are allowed in this interval.

     <STRONG>ERRORS</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_VALUE</STRONG> is generated	if <EM>n</EM> is	negative.

	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_ENUM</STRONG> is generated if <EM>type</EM> is not one of <STRONG>GL_BYTE</STRONG>,
	  <STRONG>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_SHORT</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_INT</STRONG>,
	  <STRONG>GL_UNSIGNED_INT</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_FLOAT</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_2_BYTES</STRONG>, <STRONG>GL_3_BYTES</STRONG>,
	  <STRONG>GL_4_BYTES</STRONG>.
