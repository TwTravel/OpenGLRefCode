     <STRONG>DESCRIPTION</STRONG>

	  Texture mapping is a technique that applies an image onto an
	  object's surface as if the image were	a decal	or cellophane
	  shrink-wrap. The image is created in texture space, with an
	  (s, t) coordinate system. A texture is a one-	or two-
	  dimensional image and	a set of parameters that determine how
	  samples are derived from the image.

	  <STRONG>glTexParameter</STRONG> assigns the value or values in	<EM>params</EM> to the
	  texture parameter specified as <EM>pname</EM>.	<EM>target</EM> defines the
	  target texture, either <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_1D</STRONG> or <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_2D</STRONG>.  The
	  following symbols are	accepted in <EM>pname</EM>:

	  <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER</STRONG>
		    The	texture	minifying function is used whenever
		    the	pixel being textured maps to an	area greater
		    than one texture element. There are	six defined
		    minifying functions.  Two of them use the nearest
		    one	or nearest four	texture	elements to compute
		    the	texture	value. The other four use mipmaps.

		    A mipmap is	an ordered set of arrays representing
		    the	same image at progressively lower resolutions.
		    If the texture has dimensions 2nx2m, there are
		    max(n,m)+1 mipmaps.	The first mipmap is the
		    original texture, with dimensions 2nx2m. Each
		    subsequent mipmap has dimensions 2k-1x2l-1,	where
		    2kx2l are the dimensions of	the previous mipmap,
		    until either k=0 or	l=0.  At that point,
		    subsequent mipmaps have dimension 1x2l-1 or	2k-1x1
		    until the final mipmap, which has dimension	1x1.
		    To define the mipmaps, call	<STRONG>glTexImage1D</STRONG>,
		    <STRONG>glTexImage2D</STRONG>, <STRONG>glCopyTexImage1D</STRONG>, or
		    <STRONG>glCopyTexImage2D</STRONG> with the <EM>level</EM> argument
		    indicating the order of the	mipmaps.  Level	0 is
		    the	original texture; level	max(n,m) is the	final
		    1x1	mipmap.

		    <EM>params</EM> supplies a function for minifying the
		    texture as one of the following:

		    <STRONG>GL_NEAREST</STRONG>
			      Returns the value	of the texture element
			      that is nearest (in Manhattan distance)
			      to the center of the pixel being
			      textured.

		    <STRONG>GL_LINEAR</STRONG> Returns the weighted average of the four
			      texture elements that are	closest	to the
			      center of	the pixel being	textured.
			      These can	include	border texture
			      elements,	depending on the values	of
			      <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S</STRONG>	and <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T</STRONG>,
			      and on the exact mapping.

		    <STRONG>GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST</STRONG>
			      Chooses the mipmap that most closely
			      matches the size of the pixel being
			      textured and uses	the <STRONG>GL_NEAREST</STRONG>
			      criterion	(the texture element nearest
			      to the center of the pixel) to produce a
			      texture value.

		    <STRONG>GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST</STRONG>
			      Chooses the mipmap that most closely
			      matches the size of the pixel being
			      textured and uses	the <STRONG>GL_LINEAR</STRONG>
			      criterion	(a weighted average of the
			      four texture elements that are closest
			      to the center of the pixel) to produce a
			      texture value.

		    <STRONG>GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR</STRONG>
			      Chooses the two mipmaps that most
			      closely match the	size of	the pixel
			      being textured and uses the <STRONG>GL_NEAREST</STRONG>
			      criterion	(the texture element nearest
			      to the center of the pixel) to produce a
			      texture value from each mipmap. The
			      final texture value is a weighted
			      average of those two values.

		    <STRONG>GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR</STRONG>
			      Chooses the two mipmaps that most
			      closely match the	size of	the pixel
			      being textured and uses the <STRONG>GL_LINEAR</STRONG>
			      criterion	(a weighted average of the
			      four texture elements that are closest
			      to the center of the pixel) to produce a
			      texture value from each mipmap.  The
			      final texture value is a weighted
			      average of those two values.

		    As more texture elements are sampled in the
		    minification process, fewer	aliasing artifacts
		    will be apparent. While the	<STRONG>GL_NEAREST</STRONG> and
		    <STRONG>GL_LINEAR</STRONG> minification functions can be faster
		    than the other four, they sample only one or four
		    texture elements to	determine the texture value of
		    the	pixel being rendered and can produce moire
		    patterns or	ragged transitions. The	initial	value
		    of <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER</STRONG> is
		    <STRONG>GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR</STRONG>.

	  <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER</STRONG>
		    The	texture	magnification function is used when
		    the	pixel being textured maps to an	area less than
		    or equal to	one texture element.  It sets the
		    texture magnification function to either
		    <STRONG>GL_NEAREST</STRONG> or <STRONG>GL_LINEAR</STRONG> (see below). <STRONG>GL_NEAREST</STRONG> is
		    generally faster than <STRONG>GL_LINEAR</STRONG>, but it can
		    produce textured images with sharper edges because
		    the	transition between texture elements is not as
		    smooth. The	initial	value of <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER</STRONG>
		    is <STRONG>GL_LINEAR</STRONG>.

		    <STRONG>GL_NEAREST</STRONG>
			      Returns the value	of the texture element
			      that is nearest (in Manhattan distance)
			      to the center of the pixel being
			      textured.

		    <STRONG>GL_LINEAR</STRONG> Returns the weighted average of the four
			      texture elements that are	closest	to the
			      center of	the pixel being	textured.
			      These can	include	border texture
			      elements,	depending on the values	of
			      <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S</STRONG>	and <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T</STRONG>,
			      and on the exact mapping.

	  <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S</STRONG>
		    Sets the wrap parameter for	texture	coordinate <EM>s</EM>
		    to either <STRONG>GL_CLAMP</STRONG> or <STRONG>GL_REPEAT</STRONG>.  <STRONG>GL_CLAMP</STRONG> causes
		    s coordinates to be	clamped	to the range [0,1] and
		    is useful for preventing wrapping artifacts	when
		    mapping a single image onto	an object. <STRONG>GL_REPEAT</STRONG>
		    causes the integer part of the s coordinate	to be
		    ignored; the GL uses only the fractional part,
		    thereby creating a repeating pattern. Border
		    texture elements are accessed only if wrapping is
		    set	to <STRONG>GL_CLAMP</STRONG>.  Initially, <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S</STRONG> is
		    set	to <STRONG>GL_REPEAT</STRONG>.

	  <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T</STRONG>
		    Sets the wrap parameter for	texture	coordinate <EM>t</EM>
		    to either <STRONG>GL_CLAMP</STRONG> or <STRONG>GL_REPEAT</STRONG>.  See the
		    discussion under <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S</STRONG>.	Initially,
		    <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T</STRONG> is set to	<STRONG>GL_REPEAT</STRONG>.

	  <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR</STRONG>
		    Sets a border color.  <EM>params</EM> contains four values
		    that comprise the RGBA color of the	texture
		    border. Integer color components are interpreted
		    linearly such that the most	positive integer maps
		    to 1.0, and	the most negative integer maps to
		    -1.0.  The values are clamped to the range [0,1]
		    when they are specified.  Initially, the border
		    color is (0, 0, 0, 0).

	  <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_PRIORITY</STRONG>
		    Specifies the texture residence priority of	the
		    currently bound texture.  Permissible values are
		    in the range [0, 1].  See <STRONG>glPrioritizeTextures</STRONG> and
		    <STRONG>glBindTexture</STRONG> for more information.

     <STRONG>NOTES</STRONG>
	  Suppose that a program has enabled texturing (by calling
	  <STRONG>glEnable</STRONG> with	argument <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_1D</STRONG> or <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_2D</STRONG>) and
	  has set <STRONG>GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER</STRONG>	to one of the functions	that
	  requires a mipmap.  If either	the dimensions of the texture
	  images currently defined (with previous calls	to
	  <STRONG>glTexImage1D</STRONG>,	<STRONG>glTexImage2D</STRONG>, <STRONG>glCopyTexImage1D</STRONG>,	or
	  <STRONG>glCopyTexImage2D</STRONG>) do not follow the proper sequence for
	  mipmaps (described above), or	there are fewer	texture	images
	  defined than are needed, or the set of texture images	have
	  differing numbers of texture components, then	it is as if
	  texture mapping were disabled.

	  Linear filtering accesses the	four nearest texture elements
	  only in 2D textures.	In 1D textures,	linear filtering
	  accesses the two nearest texture elements.

     <STRONG>ERRORS</STRONG>
	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_ENUM</STRONG> is generated if <EM>target</EM> or <EM>pname</EM> is not one
	  of the accepted defined values.

	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_ENUM</STRONG> is generated if <EM>params</EM> should	have a defined
	  constant value (based	on the value of	<EM>pname</EM>) and does	not.

	  <STRONG>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</STRONG> is generated if <STRONG>glTexParameter</STRONG> is
	  executed between the execution of <STRONG>glBegin</STRONG> and	the
	  corresponding	execution of <STRONG>glEnd</STRONG>.
