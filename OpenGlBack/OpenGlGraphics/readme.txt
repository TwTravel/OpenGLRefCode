This CD contains supplemental material for the textbook.
There are 6 top-level folders:

BOOK_PROGRAMS: Contains all the programs in Appendix A and 
other demo programs.There is a Windows binary for each program.
There is also a sample Visual C++ project folder. The folder SCENE_GRAPH
contains the source code for the scene graph library in Chapter 9.

GLUT: zip and tar files for GLUT 3.6 source and data files for the demos.
There is also a zip file for the Windows binaries for GLUT 3.7.6

MAN_PAGES: Man pages in both postscript and html formats for gl, glu, and glx.
There is also a zip file containing all the man pages in both formats.

MESA: Mesa 4 distribution in zip format including Mesa demos. Mesa is an open
source OpenGL that is included in most linux distributions. 

SIGGRAPH: pdf files for the OpenGL tutorial taught at SIGGRAPH 2001 by
Dave Shreiner, Ed Angel, and Vicki Shreiner. 

TUTORS: Interactive tutorial programs written by Nate Robins while a student intern 
at SGI to illustrate basic OpenGL functions with a variety of obejcts. Source and binaries 
for Windows. The demos include:

	shapes: basic OpenGL primitives

	projection: OpenGL functions for perspective and orthographic viewing

	transformation: translation, rotation, and scaling

	lightmaterial: light and material parameters

	lightposition: moving the light source

	texture: texture functions and parameters

	fog: OpenGL fog functions
