Geomorphing Geospheres V 1.0

This program was based off the OpenGl programming guide's subdivision geosphere's section,
and add adds geomorphing to it.

Notes: 
Real life distance mode is currently pretty useless as every planet is beyond far away.
Speed Could be improved by culling more faces out.
LOD setup would be better if it was progressive per planet.
Demo runs well on a p200 and would probably run on even slower computers
This Code Could be used as a base to some progressive mesh structure, or it could
be the beginnnings to a cool astrology program, or it could just exist for you
to look at and enjoy.
Enjoy
